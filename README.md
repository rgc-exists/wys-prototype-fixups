# Will You Snail Prototype Build Fix-Ups
2 of the 3 prototype builds for Will You Snail that were recently TEMPORARILY made public had game breaking bug(s), so here's some fixes.

# UPDATE: JONAS IS OK WITH US SHARING
![Comment from Jonas saying it's ok to reupload the builds](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945749121732583436/1046570463960256532/image.png)


# You need your own copy of the prototypes to run this!
I do not have permission to make the files for these games public. If you are/were lucky enough to find and get the builds before the TEMPORARY download link that the dev's friend gave expired, you can apply the bps files in this repository to the data.win files in the builds using a program like FLIPS. [DOWNLOAD FLIPS HERE.](https://dl.smwcentral.net/11474/floating.zip)

# What to do if you don't have a copy of the prototypes
If the link hasn't expired yet, you can get it here: https://we.tl/t-T3E5LJ0kdF
But it will only be up for a few days as of the time I'm writing this, so be fast.
If the link is expired, I don't know what to tell you. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
